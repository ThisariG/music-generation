# Music Generation using Deep Learning
This repo contains the implementation of music generation models and several generated samples.

Two model architecures have been used to implement the models.
1. LSTM Network
2. Wave net Architecture - [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499)

A small dataset has been used to train and the model architecture is simple compared to the state of the art. The quality could be improved by further tuning the hyper parameters, using a larger dataset and using architectures like [Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).
